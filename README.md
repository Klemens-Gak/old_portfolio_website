# old_portfolio_website
My dld portfolio website. Recently a little bit upgrated and renewed. You can find it on www.grzegorz.klementowski.pl.

While studying in Poland, I decided to pursue freelancing to gain more practical experience from real-world jobs. After completing a few website and Excel macro projects, I chose to create my own website and invest time in marketing. Although I never finished it, I've since updated it and published the repository on GitHub..
